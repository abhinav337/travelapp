# Travel App
A travel app that lets you know the details of your trip, summary and weather conditions of your destination.


## Detail Description
The project which was built for Udacity uses 3 different APIs (Geonames API, Weatherbit API and Pixabay API) and gets the info of your trip to display on the UI.

The project implements and uses:
- Webpack with plugins and loaders
- NPM
- Express server
- Service workers
- Page design and layout
- Sass styling
- API uses and responses


## Preparation
The project can be executed on local server by installing the packages which can be found in `packages.json`. Node and Express are used to run the server.
	
The API keys can be generated by signing up at [Geonamens](http://www.geonames.org/), [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) which can be placed in the api.js file

## Installation Process
Install all the necessary dependencies and packages by typing in the following command

```bash
npm install
```

Server can be started for Development and Production environments by the following commands respectively.

```bash
npm run build-dev
npm run build-prod
npm run start
```

Your server can be found at http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
(Use Chrome for better results)


## Result
When a destination, Start Date and End Date is submitted through the browser, the app returns the entire details of the trip with a photo, weather details and summary of the weather.
